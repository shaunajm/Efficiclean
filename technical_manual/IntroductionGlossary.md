# 1. Introduction

## 1.1 Overview

Our idea in centred around the way housekeeping staff currently operate in hotels. At the moment, staff must walk up and down the halls in hotels to check what rooms have signs on them saying “Do not disturb” or “Please service my room”. Staff members are assigned a floor and if there are no rooms on their floor to be cleaned they must wait somewhere until they check the hall again. This system is extremely inefficient.

We intend to build an application that would modernise this area of work. Instead of guests using a piece of paper on the door to notify staff when rooms are available to be cleaned they will use this application to mark the status of their room and be notified when their room is cleaned. Cleaning staff will be able to see on a web interface when rooms are ready to be cleaned, be assigned rooms and mark them as completed. This will result in this process being more efficient, safer, more accessible and better kept track of. 

Rooms will have a QR code for users to download the application. They will enter their hotel ID and Room Number which will be within their room. Alongside this information, users enter their forename and surname. The application will then check the database to see if this guest is in the room. The user will then be logged into the application and be presented with home screen. Guests will also use this method of logging in on the web application.

The main features of our project are:

-	A staff interface diplaying the cleaning status of rooms in the hotel

-	Priority queue system for cleaning team allocation to hotel rooms

-	Remote notification for guests when their room is marked clean on the system

-	Guest login via QR code in hotel room alongside verification of guest by database query 

-	Option to add feedback and rate a room's clean

-	Database interaction to automatically log out guests when their stay is over

-	Staff work statistics generated for supervisor and manager

-	Randomly allocated cleaning pairs daily to increase security
