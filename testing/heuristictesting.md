# Heuristic Testing

## Shneiderman's Eight Golden Rules

### Strive for consistency.

Throughout our application we ensured that similar terminology was used to avoid confusion. As you can see below, elements such as the submit button are recognisable on each page.

Resembling actions are carried out in the same manner. The consistency of each of these elements ensures that Efficiclean is easy to use.

#### Report Hazard and Severe Mess pages:

#### List Hazard and Severe Mess pages:

As we can see from each of the above pages, the background and font colours throughout Efficiclean are the same. We utilised red and gold as they symbolised royalty and high quality. 

### Enable frequent users to use shortcuts.

(Guests remaining logged in)

### Offer informative feedback

Once a guest marks the status of their room they are informed which option they have selected and provided with information on this option. Similarly, once a staff member sends a room to supervisor approval they will receive a pop up to let them know the room has been sent for approval. This feedback allows users to know that the action they have completed has been successful.

### Design dialog to yield closure

Actions such as guests marking the status of their rooms has a clear sequence of actions. Guests first login to Efficiclean using their hotel ID, room number, first name and surname. They then progress onto the home screen and have three options “Please service my room”, “Do not disturb” and “Checking out”. Once the guest selects an option they are presented with a page to inform them what status there room is currently marked as.

### Offer simple error handling.

Users will not be able to make errors in Efficiclean as they will receive a pop up to inform them of their error. An example of this is if a user does not fill in a field when logging into the application. They will be informed that this needs to be changed for them to log into the application.

### Permit easy reversal of actions.

Throughout Efficiclean there is a back button in the toolbar to allow users to return to the previous page if they have made a mistake. Similarly, if a user marks their room as do not disturb, they have the option to change this until a certain time.

### Support internal locus of control

Users have full control of the application. The guests get to choose to the status of the rooms, the staff and supervisor get to select what actions they perform in the application. Users initiate all actions within the application.

### Reduce short-term memory load.

As our short term memory supports only 5 to 9 items at one time, we kept our user interface as simple as possible. This means that users are not overloaded with information and can enjoy using the application.
