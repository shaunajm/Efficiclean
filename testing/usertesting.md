# User Testing

## User Testing Plan

To complete user testing we will hold two separate user testing sessions. We will have two sessions so that we can take feedback onboard from the first session and see what other issues users may find in the second session.

We will ask users to complete a survey and following on from this complete a short interview. Both of these methods will be utilised to ensure that we gather both qualitative and quantitative data to ensure that we are provided with as much information about our application as possible. Below is an example of our survey and questionnaire questions.

Once we have gathered this information we will take all feedback onboard to make corrections and changes that users would like to see present in Efficiclean.

## User Testing Phase 1

As mentioned in the user testing plan, we decided to implement our user testing in two phases. We would implement a week between these two user testing stages to allow us to make changes and improve our application before asking users what their opinions are now to ensure we implement all changes correctly.

*Question 1*           | *Question 2*           | *Question 3*

### 6.2 User Testing Phase two

Our first stage of user testing taught us a vast amount about our application and what users would like to see in the application. We took all of the feedback from the first round of user testing onboard and applied it to our application. Thankfully, this paid off as we received improved feedback from our users. This can be seen throughout our survey results.

*Question 1*           | *Question 2*           | *Question 3*

The user gave feedback on the issue they were facing. We will resolve this issue.|Again, all users found the application enjoyable to use which we were delighted to see.|Overall, users were happy with our application.


User testing was very helpful in helping us discover issues that we would not have discovered without this testing. Different points of view meant exploring aspects of the application which we had not considered and brought about many issues which will be fixed. As the results show, users opinions of the application greatly increased between both phases of testing which assured us that we were heading the correct way with our changes. We gave users a voice to help us tailor Efficiclean to the user and it greatly impacted the application.
