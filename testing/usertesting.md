# User Testing 

## User Testing Plan 

To complete user testing we will hold two separate user testing sessions. We will have two sessions so that we can take feedback onboard from the first session and see what other issues users may find in the second session. 

We will ask users to complete a survey and following on from this complete a short interview. Both of these methods will be utilised to ensure that we gather both qualitative and quantitative data to ensure that we are provided with as much information about our application as possible. Below is an example of our survey and questionnaire questions.

Once we have gathered this information we will take all feedback onboard to make corrections and changes that users would like to see present in Efficiclean.
